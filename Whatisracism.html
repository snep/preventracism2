<p><b>What do you think Racism is? Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior. To sum up this definition it means the discrimination of different types of race. When someone is being racist they are discriminating a group of people.  Can you imagine one day you were having a perfectly good day and then someone walks up to you and does this. You would feel hurt, angry, sad, and much more bad feelings.</b></p>
