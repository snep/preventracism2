<h3>Shooting Kabul-</h3>
<p><b>Another example of racism can be found in this book, Shooting Kabul. Racism can relate to the book Shooting Kabul by N. S. Senzai. A bully that always tries to let you down comes up to you one day. He says, “You’re Muslim! You’re a terrorist! Get him!” and he beats you up on the spot. This is right after the 9/11 attacks when terrorists from Afghanistan and Pakistan attacked the twin towers in New York, USA. As you can see, the bully mentions the targets race, and discriminates him, and he accuses him as a terrorist because he is from Afghanistan. This is pure racism. Using a race and inflicting negativity towards it and stereotypically. This is also trying to prove that one race is superior over another because the bully is inflicting negativity to the Muslim race making it seem like it’s in the shadow of another's race even though it really is not at all. Think of the feelings going through your head if this happened to you. You should be proud in what you believe in, Racism is trying to make you feel the opposite. And, no race has superiority over another. This is racism, and let’s put an end to this right now and forever in our world today.</b></p>
